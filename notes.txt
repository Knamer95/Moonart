1) If you try to add to a component style the selector [data-mode="day-bg"] (+ selector), it won't work. The reason is that it's in the child component, while data-mode is from app.component (the main parent)
   So, you cannot reference to selectors outside of the child scope.

   Solution for modals -> Add the rules to [data-mode="{x}-bg"] instead, since modals have to be out of the child container, due to how they are made.

2) After investigating the issues with AJAX calls, I found this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12894822/access-denied-error-on-rename-call-when-uploading-files-in-symfony
   After downloading MoonArt in a virtual machine, and running it, I concluded that there is a problem with Symfony/Doctrine and Windows.
